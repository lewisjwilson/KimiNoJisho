# kiminojisho (kmj)

KimiNoJisho is the ultimate Japanese dictionary and custom flashcard app solution. With kmj, you can search for new Japanese words using Jisho's API. If you think the word will come in handy later on, just star it to add it to your list! Once your list is created, you can browse the items, or start a SRS flashcard game on your own personal Japanese list to improve your memorisation skills! This means you can improve your targeted areas of Japanese, rather than following generalised premade decks.


Features include:
- An easy to use interface
- Your own personal list/dictionary
- Dictionary searhing via the Jisho API


Upcoming Features:
- Daily Flashcard Notifications
- A SRS Flashcard style game
