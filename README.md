# KimiNoJisho

“KimiNoJisho” is a custom dictionary application, used for storing custom dictionary entries from Japanese to English. If, just like me, you seem to be coming across so many new words and phrases in Japanese that you just can’t seem to keep track of them, then this is the app for you.

KimiNoJisho provides a slick and simple interface for adding new words to the dictionary. Add a new word (Kanji is supported), the Kana reading (Hiragana or Katakana), punch in the meaning of the word in English and an example use (optional) and away you go. My advice before adding new words, is to research it online or through a Japanese friend, to make sure you have the meaning and example correct! Once the word is in the dictionary, you can be worry free…get studying!
